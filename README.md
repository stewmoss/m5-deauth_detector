## Overview

The Deauth Detector transforms your M5Stack Cardputer into a dedicated security monitoring device that continuously scans for 802.11 deauthentication frames—a common attack vector used to disconnect clients from wireless networks.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Attack Detection** — Monitors for deauthentication packets on protected networks
- **Multi-channel Scanning** — Intelligently hops only across channels where your networks broadcast
- **Hardware Alerts** — Immediate buzzer and LED notification when attacks are detected
- **Web Configuration** — Browser-based setup interface with tabbed configuration
- **SD Card Logging** — Persistent CSV logging of all detected events
- **API Reporting** — Batch reporting to external security systems via REST API
- **Alert Integrations** — Extensible alerting via SMTP email, WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS, ntfy, MQTT and more
- **NTP Time Sync** — Accurate timestamps for all logged events

## Hardware Requirements

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Device | M5Stack Cardputer (ESP32-S3 StampS3) |
| Storage | MicroSD card (FAT32 formatted) |
| Display | Built-in 240×135 ST7789 TFT LCD |
| Input | Integrated keyboard + G0 button |
| Alerts | SK6812 RGB LED + Buzzer |

## Quick Start

1. **Flash the firmware** using PlatformIO
2. **Insert a FAT32 formatted SD card**
3. **Power on** — device enters configuration mode automatically
4. **Connect to the `M5-DeauthDetector` WiFi network**
5. **Navigate to `http://192.168.4.1`** and configure your settings
6. **Save and restart** — monitoring begins automatically
